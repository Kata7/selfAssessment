# Self Assessment - Block 1

## 1. What areas do you feel you are struggling the most in? (Be specific, technologies, habits, etc.)
```
To be 100% honest my #1 struggle is definitely being responsible with my sleep.  I'm not doing that bad, but some nights I only get 6-7 hours and it negatively affects my work day.  This typically manifests as me doing less work than I should on that particular day. 
```

## 2. Develop a plan using S.M.A.R.T. goals to continue progress in the areas you mentioned above. *S.M.A.R.T. - Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Timely.*
```
Specific: get more sleep.
Measurable: get 8 hours of sleep.
Attainable: get in bed at 10:30pm, be asleep by 11:00pm
Relevant: will help my work at gSchool improve
Timely: start tomorrow
```

## 3. Look back at Block 1, choose 3 'aha' moments where something clicked and describe them below.
```
1.  Understanding that the DOM turns HTML elements into objects
2.  How asynchronous code is handled and how to use it via Fetch
3.  Everything about event handlers
```

## 4. What areas do you feel the most confident in? What is making you happy right now?
```
I feel the most confident in the technical aspects of the program.  I do worry a bit about the career services aspect (linkedIn and resumes)
```

## 5. What technologies/industries are you most excited about currently?
```
I'm not super well versed in what technologies are up and coming.  That being said, I am excited to start learning react.js
